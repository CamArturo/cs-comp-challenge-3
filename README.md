# Final Static Comp Challenge

The static comp challenge is a series of three challenges to work on HTML/CSS.

This static comp was built from scratch. 
In this project I used scalable svg fonts, CSS grid and Flexbox. This is very little JS. The 
JS is only used for a mobile menu to show mobile functionality.
